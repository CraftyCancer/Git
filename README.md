# Git

Git is a version Control System.

Version Control is software that tracks and manages changes to file over time.

Version Control allow users to revisit earlier versions of the files, compare changes between versions, undo changes and a whole lot more.

Git helps with:

1. Track Changes across multiple files.
2. Compare versions of a project.
3. "Time-Travel" back to old versions.
4. Revert to a pervious version.
5. Collabrate and share changes.
6. Combine Changes.
